        "Biometrics is one of the most emerging fields. Biometrics can be defined as the process of identifying and verifying the individual based on measurable and distinctive personality traits where measurable means the process of presenting the traits of the person to the sensor which convert it into a digital format and distinctive means the variations of biometric features separating one person from another. \n",
        "                                           One of the most interesting and researched parts of biometrics field is Facial Recognition. Facial Recognition can be defined as the process of recording and processing spatial geometry of different features of the face.  In simple words the capability of discovering and verifying a human being from the data in the form of video frame or digital. Some of the other definitions of facial recognition say it is a biometric artificial intelligence which is used to recognize the human being specifically with the help of analyzation of facial patterns and textures. Facial recognition is one of the most prominent technique in Biometrics that is being used these days for identifying individuals on daily basis. In human body face is the only part that can be captured from far away using a high definition camera or satellite imaging which can later be converted to the digital format to be used for facial recognition. Although there are numerous methods defined on how facial recognition works, there is a comparison of facial features that takes place among provided pictures of face which are fetched from database. The current popular usage is securely signing in devices like mobiles and laptops. Therefore, it acts as access control. In comparison to iris recognition or finger recognition, accuracy is slightly less.\n",

        "\n",
        "The facial recognition is the most focused and crucial research area in deep learning and pattern recognition. While performing and deployment of facial recognition, it is important to be aware of classical pattern recognition, and facial recognition is two different terms. Both have different set of rules. Unlike facial recognition, classical pattern recognition focusses on massive availability of datasets for every class. Moreover, availability of training dataset is more in pattern recognition as compared to facial recognition.\n",
        " To understand some algorithms for facial recognition in distinctive lightening and contrasting expressions, two techniques have been focused on the chosen paper Eigenface and Fisherfaces method.\n",

        "                      **Figure 2:- Facial Recognition Under Different Lighting Condition, Belhumeur et al. (1997)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Fisherface:\n",
        "Fisherface method is developed based on Linear Discriminant Analysis. It focuses on maximizing the inter-class difference. It has no role in dealing with data representation. In other words, determinant of a between-class matrix is increased, and determinant of within-class matrix is decreased. Both these tasks are done simultaneously. In Fisherfaces, it was found that linear projections can be used to deduce the dimensions as classes are convex.\n",
        "Eigenface:\n",
        "The base of Eigenface implementation is PCA (Principle Computer Analysis). The goal of this method is to decrease the dimensionality of an image matrix. A linear transformation is said to be used by this method for face recognition in illumination or pose change.\n",
        "There are two kinds of datasets in the paper, one is the test, and other one is learning. The test set contains unlabelled pictures and learning set contain labeled pictures with the identity of human beings.\n",

        "\n",
        "The above figure shows the comparison of PCA and LDA in which sample of classes and linear subspace are plotted perpendicularly to each other, which results in simple classification because between-class scatter is maximized.\n",
        "Linear Subclass:\n",
        "In this method, there will be zero error rate if there is no shadowing applied rules of Lambertian Reflectance Model should be followed.\n",
        "Correlation:\n",
        "Process of normalization has been followed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparison between four methods has been discussed on the above dataset, and those methods are correlation, Eigenface, Linear Subspaces and Fisherfaces which are used in resolving face recognition issues. There is number of disadvantages found in correlation, Eigenface, and Linear Subspace methods for example Correlation method and Linear Subclass is computationally expensive.  None of these three methods get succeeded in changing high dimensional space to low dimensional space to get the best results or to decrease the error rate. However, Fisherfaces does well with high accuracy in results as compared to other three.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the results in comparison of four methods in three different situations:\n",
        "1)\tDISTINCTIVE LIGHTENING:\n",
        "Fisherface performed best in this situation with fewer errors and consumed considerable computational time for classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)\tCHANGE IN EXPRESSIONS OR POSE:\n",
        "According to this paper, when the picture of full face is processed, the outcome of results is found better for four of the methods as discussed above, but that doesn’t exist practically. To process the photo of complete face leads to decrease the rate of recognitions. This is because difference in background or difference in hairstyle leads to increase errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)\tGLASS RECOGNITION:\n",
        "In this section, two methods became successful, Fisherface scored first, and Linear Subspace scored second. Also, Fisherface again achieves fewer error rates during handling of variations in lighting, but Linear Subspace couldn’t perform well in managing variations in facial expressions. While Eigenface had high error rates than others. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Innovation**\n",
        "\n",
        "I found this paper a good paper as results are defined well, and comparison is done well among four methods discussed in the paper to reduce face recognition problem. Results are verified on Harvard and Yale Face database. For better visualization of results, results are verified based on the two-class problem in which every class exists nearby linear subspace. \n",
        "While judging the working of Eigenface method in uncertain lightening conditions, it has been innovated that eviction of three principle components can lead to increase in the functionality of the same. To improve the quality and performance of the Eigenface method under various lighting conditions these three principal components are highly recommended to be removed. But removing these components will result in increasing the errors generated resulting in making this technique inappropriate to be used.\n",
        "Secondly, it has been innovated that variation in face poses results in failure of linear subspace method. \n",
        "However, the accuracy of methods explained in this paper is not good as compared to another deep learning algorithm present. If I will talk about deep learning, CNN has achieved huge success in overcoming this facial recognition issues and is being used for high-security purposes by lots of big firms. Deep learning has already done well in facial recognition area, and different lighting condition, changes in facial expression and effect of glasses in facial recognition has been done by deep learning.\n",
        "So, nothing new is developed which can be used over another useful algorithm (e.g. CNN) available in the market. There are two reasons behind it, Fisherface which is considered best among four discussed in this paper doesn’t work well in extreme lighting variations, and it requires huge number of pictures which are clicked from various viewpoints. These kinds of images are not available in real-world applications. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Technical Quality**\n",
        "\n",
        "The technical quality of this paper is perfect. The technical aspects have been explained well and that too in a very effortless and manageable manner.\n",
        "Firstly, the author has explained the basic set rules used for facial recognition, and how important is to resolve issues that occur in recognizing face in different situations. Secondly, four methods have been explained in depth to get an understandable idea how these methodologies are working in tackling the issue and what obstacles they are facing and how one disadvantage of one method is overcome by other methods. It is clearly shown how the testing set should be mapped with learning set and to correlate both sets to get the classification done appropriately. \n",
        "Next, how three original images are combined linearly can help reconstruct the picture of the surface condition applied here is the image should be under an arbitrary lighting direction.\n",
        "Lastly, using normalization process, make mean of images as zero to enhance the performance of Eigenface and Correlation test.\n",
        "In a nutshell, there is nothing wrong with the technicality of this paper; it is completely a technically sound paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application and X-Factor**\n",
        "\n",
        "A little bit about applications has been discussed in the paper. In which, one application which is face recognition is defined under three conditions. This application is also consisting limitations like less accuracy in illumination or variable face poses. Accuracy of the mentioned methods is not considered for solving face recognition under different lighting which can be left these methods apart from getting used for high-security purposes. \n",
        "In my opinion, face recognition in dark lighting only or face detection from live video using Eigenface or Fisherface methods should be developed in the research sector for more growth and development. As compared to a deep learning algorithm, these methods require less computation cost and time. So, there should be more focus on these algorithms to increase the use of these methods in this era of research.\n",
        "X-Factor:\n",
        "Studying the paper thoroughly, I couldn’t find much of X-factors. The dramatic enhancement in the accuracy of Fisherface is the X-factor I found, where the error rate of this method got decreased from 7.3% to 0.6% where whole face was trained by this method. But I would say, in the past the same research has been carried out, there are not many newly developed methods discussed in this paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Presentation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The presentation of this paper is well understandable for all types of readers irrespective of their background. I will rate this paper 4 out of 5. It was easy to interpret the paper and learn about the methods mentioned and their working. It is presented very sequentially so that user can understand from the basic without having any kind of confusion or scratching their head wondering from where all the concepts are coming out. On the other hand, I am disappointed with the depth of this paper. It should be exaggerated to have complete knowledge of the methods and their future scope in the research. \n",
