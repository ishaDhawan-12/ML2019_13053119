        "Prediction of Cyber Attacks with Data Analytics\n",
        "\n",
        "**Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "Innovation could be a double-edged sword. Criminals are using technology and innovation for serious crimes. One of the solutions for that is the government and private agencies should follow the same approach that is being used by criminals. Agencies should use technology to predict the crimes and prevent them from happening. For this approach agencies needs advanced tools based on machine learning. So that they can analyse the collected data regarding the attacks to predict the pattern and how particular attacks take place and what is the mentality of the attackers behind such attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Aim and Objectives**\n",
        "\n",
        "The point of writing this report is to propose the idea that will be based upon the Data analytics. Inside this proposed idea we will use the data related to cybercrime that will be provided to us by government agencies to develop a crime analysis program. This proposed idea can be used for the purpose of future crime detection. Also, it will help to reduce the number of committed crimes.\n",
        "To achieve the above mentioned aim, we have to look into the various aspects of collected data related to the crime investigations such as where the crime is committed, who committed the crime, what were the specifications or details about the crime scene and the person who committed the crime. Based on the requirement needed for this project we have divided the aim into four major objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tThe first objective that we identified is to understand the issue that why we need the future crime prediction platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tSecond objective is to gather the data from government agencies related to crime. \n",
        "\n",
        "•\tEvaluating the procedure, work plan and classifiers need to develop the proposed platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "•\tSmall prototype development for the evaluation of the proposed model. Based on this prototype developing a full-fledged working model that can be used by various crime agencies and by the government.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Background**\n",
        "\n",
        "Increasing cyber-attacks and increasing crime rate with advancement in technology is one of the prime concerns that needs immediate attention of both government parties as well as security agencies. Government and security agencies still using old traditional methods to track cyber criminals and failing constantly because attackers these days are using advanced machine learning and AI based methods to exploit the vulnerabilities inside organizations. \n",
        "As depicted in below figure 1. The crime rate has increased tremendously, and the damage caused by increasing cybercrime attacks is approximately 2,719 million U.S. Dollars. It is increasing continuously because there are not enough methods to predict the patterns of recurring attacks. The facts behind this prediction thing is that there is not enough data and Government agencies, security researchers are still trying to make the traditional methods better rather than thinking about alternatives such as machine learning algorithms that can analyse data, predict the data to stop the attacks before taking place.\n",
        "\n",
        "![alt text](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Statistic/265000/267132-blank-355.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "The previous methods to tackle cyber-security attacks can not predict the attack before it takes place. These methods are helpful to prevent cyber-attacks but less efficient in detect attacks before happening. But the proposed application will work on prediction and analyzation of data to detect efficiently the attack before they attackers plan to execute the attack.\n",
        "In our research report we will gather the data from agencies as well as, from the organizations that have faced the attacks this way we can get enough data that will help us to construct this platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Research** \n",
        "\n",
        "**Significance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The project can help huge number of security providers to tackle cyber crimes with data analytics. As everybody knows cyber attacks resulted in huge loss of money, time and reputations. Developing an application to deal with it leads to save a lot of money that has been spending securing data all over the world and in detecting and preventing cybercrimes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Innovation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Innovation for this project is that this project will help to make it easier for security researchers to predict the cyberattacks before it happens. This innovation will help the developers, security experts to gather and analyse previous cyber-attacks information and with the help of machine learning algorithms predict the attacking places and secure them before they become prey of cyber-attacks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Action plan:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In project plan is divide into few parts that are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        " **Understanding the problem:** \n",
        "\n",
        "The depth understanding of this topic is must for the success of this project. Evaluation will be done in the first phase of the project to decide what kind of attacks are major threat. For this task, specific set of forensics experts and security researchers will be allowed to work on it. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Extraction of data:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Second phase of the project will start that is extracting specific parameters from the collected information by analysts. \n",
        "The data will be gathered from various sources such as feedback, surveys, questionaries, data provided by government and data that is recorded by organization during the ongoing attack on their IT infrastructure. The collected data will contain various attack parameters, vulnerabilities that were exploited by the attacker, type of virus or exploit used to gain access to system. Also, the motive behind the attack will be recorded such as what was the intention of attacker to steal data or to infect the server. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Developing the model:**\n",
        "\n",
        "To develop the model, it is required to convert the extracted data into useful and understandable form of data. The main thing is to choose useful attributes from the extracted data and perform data classification and data pre-processing. For data classification, classifiers like Random Forest, Linear Regression or Support Vector Machine can be used. After that training of models will be done. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Testing the prototype:**\n",
        "\n",
        "After developing the successful model, the next step will be to develop a small prototype and test this prototype in a small controlled environment to test and evaluate the results. In this controlled environment specific conditions will be created regarding different cyber-security attacks and this model will be tested against these attacks. The outcomes will be in the form that cyber attack will happen or no.\n",
        "The results and this small prototype will be sent to specific organizations with a trial license of small periods and the performance of this prototype will be recorded using a remote server and later on the results will be matched with the pre-tests that were performed inside the controlled environment and the defects and good points will be taken into consideration to produce the final working model.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Application:**\n",
        "\n",
        "After careful evaluation of the prototype the final model will be generated. The cost and timeline for the final model will be generated. The prototype will be created on a large-scale model. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Timeline:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Different processes to develop this application will take different time to execute. The timeline of our project is given below:\n",

Business Analyst to monitor all the actions performed during the project and work on parameters to generate good revenue from this project. However, to implement hardware and to perform functions on software a team of hardware and software expertise is required. Network administrator will control all issues related to networking. Proposed application will be further managed by web developers. Office staff to do all the secondary tasks required to develop an application will be considered.\n",
